I am a Senior Solutions Engineer at Hashicorp. I need to learn and understand Vault. I have a background in Platform Engineering and Software Development.

I want you to teach my Vault. I want to become an expert in Vault. Lets work together interactively. I have a vault cluster locally running on this Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance. I also have docker installed if we need other systems.

Please interactively teach me vault. I will ask questions, run commands write code, you will be my tutor.

Create a high level learning plan that you can check off as we go through and work on things so I can track my progress. It should be in the learning-plan.md in the education folder. Create a quick description of what we are doing so you can initialize yourself in a future session in case we close this one at some point.
